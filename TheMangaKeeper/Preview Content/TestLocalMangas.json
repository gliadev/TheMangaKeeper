Fortunately, nothing has been a hurdle in their relationship, and their meeting's first anniversary is near—a chance for Issei to turn over a new leaf. However, his zealous spirit quickly fades when Ban suddenly dies in a car accident on the exact day.\n\nHaving no other companion in the world, Issei is drowning in regret with a broken heart, wishing he could turn back time. But when supernatural forces interfere, Issei finds himself in the past, days before Ban's death. Now presented with a second chance, Issei is eager to make up for his shortcomings and save his partner from a tragic fate.\n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
